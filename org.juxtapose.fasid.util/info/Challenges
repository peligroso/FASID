Update overtake
 
 update		A		B
 			\		/
 				Obj1
 				A||B
 				 ||
				Obj2
			
			B overtakes A between update from Obj1 to Obj2
			Obj2 will be recalculated with data from "Obj1 update B" and then recalculated from "Obj2 update A"
			Leaving Obj2 in a state calculated from "Obj2 update A", which is stale.
